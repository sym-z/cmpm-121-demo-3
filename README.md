## NOTE ABOUT MULTIPLE COMMITS FOR THE FINAL COMMIT OF D3a

Had a small git issue with Github desktop where it repeated a commit -> merge
process and made multiple commits accidentally after one click to the "push"
button. It was a problem that stemmed from me trying to learn how to amend a
commit using only VS Code and GitHub Desktop, instead of through a terminal like
I usually do. I did not intend to commit something multiple times and push with
the same commit message. It was an accidental push of a button in GitHub Desktop
that caused the multiple commit copies. I wanted to explain in case it seemed
like I was not amending a commit properly when I should have. I am going to use
the terminal to amend commits from now on.
